## What is an Annotated Bibliography?

In case you’re not familiar, an annotated bibliography is a list of sources used in a research project, each accompanied by a brief summary and evaluation. This helps to demonstrate the quality and relevance of the sources and allows readers to see how each one contributes to your research.

For example, an annotated bibliography might include the following:

- **Full citation:** The full reference for the source in the required citation style.
- **Summary:** A brief overview of the content of the source, including key points, findings, and conclusions.
- **Evaluation:** An assessment of the source’s credibility, relevance, and quality, including its contribution to your research.

## Benefits of Having a Well-Written Annotated Bibliography

Annotated bibliographies serve several important purposes in academic research:

- **Organized Research:** An annotated bibliography helps you keep track of the sources you’ve used in your research and understand their relevance.
- **Shows Depth of Research:** By summarizing and evaluating sources, you demonstrate that you have thoroughly researched your topic and are able to critically assess the materials.
- **Improves Credibility:** A well-constructed annotated bibliography boosts the credibility of your work by showing that you’ve used reliable, authoritative sources.
